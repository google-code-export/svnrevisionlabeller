# Introduction #

Please ensure that you have the software listed below before attempting to use this software.

## Mandatory ##

  * CruiseControl.NET 1.5 - the plugin has been compiled and tested against this version of CC.NET;
  * .NET Framework 2.0 - this is actually a requirement for CC.NET, but it doesn't hurt to make it explicit;
  * Subversion client - again, hopefully you already have the Subversion client installed as part of your configuration of CC.NET.

## Optional ##

  * Visual Studio 2008 - if you want to build from source, debug or or add any modifications.
